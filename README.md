# Responsive Web Design Course - FreeCodeCamp

Hello there! I'm excited to share my experience with the Responsive Web Design course offered by FreeCodeCamp. In this course, I was able to review and reinforce my HTML and CSS skills by building responsive websites.

## Course Overview
The course was designed by FreeCodeCamp. It helped me to  refresh and reinforce my knowledge of responsive web design principles. It covered how to use HTML and CSS to create web pages that can adapt to different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices. The course was broken down into several sections, each covering a different aspect of web design.

## Prerequisites
Since I already had prior knowledge of HTML and CSS, I was able to skip the Basic HTML and Basic CSS courses. However, I still reviewed the course materials to refresh my knowledge and ensure that I had a solid foundation for the more advanced topics covered in this course.

## Course Content
The course covered the following topics:

### Responsive Web Design Principles
This section covered the fundamental principles of responsive web design, including media queries, flexbox, and grid layouts.

### Applied Visual Design
In this section, I learned how to apply visual design principles to create engaging and user-friendly web pages.

### Responsive Web Design Projects
The course included several projects that I completed to reinforce my learning. These projects were designed to help me build practical experience in designing responsive websites.

## Projects Completed
I built the following four projects while doing this course:

### 1. Survey Form
For this project, I created a survey form using HTML and CSS. The form included various input types, such as radio buttons, checkboxes, and text fields.

### 2. Documentation Page
I created a documentation page using HTML and CSS. The page included various sections with text and images.

### 3. Tribute Page
For this project, I created a tribute page using HTML and CSS. The page was dedicated to a historical figure, and included images, text, and links.

### 4. Product Landing Page
I created a landing page for a fictional product using HTML and CSS. The page included a pricing cards , features  and contact section.

### 5. Portfolio Website
As a final project, I created a portfolio website to showcase my work. The website included various sections, such as about me, projects, and contact information.

By building these projects, I gained practical experience in applying responsive web design principles and techniques. I also developed my skills in HTML and CSS.

## Credits
I want to give credit to FreeCodeCamp for providing this course for free. Without their efforts to make learning web development accessible and affordable, I would not have been able to review and reinforce my skills.

## Conclusion
By the end of this course, I had refreshed my knowledge of responsive web design principles and techniques. I also gained practical experience in designing responsive websites. Overall, I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their HTML and CSS skills.
